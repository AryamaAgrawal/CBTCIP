Hello, I am Aryama Agrawal. This is the repository for all of the works I've completed in my virtual internship at CipherByte Technologies.
At first, we have the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Finally, we have the Mastermind Game.

1. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
- Description: This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows players to play against the computer and test their luck and strategy.
- Technologies Used: Python, basic algorithms

2. Mastermind Game
- Description: The Mastermind game is a code-breaking game where one player sets a secret code, and the other player tries to guess the code within a certain number of turns. This project implements the game logic and provides an interactive interface for players.
- Technologies Used: Python, algorithm design
